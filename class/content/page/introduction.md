Welcome to my _self-inflicted_ **course on Compilers, Formal Grammars and Programming Languages!**

This is a subject I had been wanting to explore for a long time. It wasn't taught as part of my BSc in Software Engineering, and my other degrees were about Automation and Optimization, so it fell off the table.

Yet, I felt I could not stand this large missing piece of knowledge for very long. Thus, I gathered the best MOOC and the 2 best books on the arguments and started studying.

True to [my own ideas on MOOCs](https://medium.com/@pgrandinetti/make-the-most-out-of-your-mooc-97f806e6a70) I decided to self-assign to myself a complex project: **to build a new programming language**, without using any of the automated tools available out there, in order to practice and implement with my own hands all concepts.

The overall learning experience has been fantastic, and its results are:

- A [series of articles/classes]({{< ref "/" >}}) on the subject (start from here!).
- A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pgrandinetti/compilers) for a new programming language.


### Get in touch

MOOCs are only half-useful without other students' feedback. I warmly encourage you to get in touch for questions, comments and suggestions. You can:

- Reach out via [my LinkedIn page](https://linkedin.com/in/grandinettipietro)
- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pgrandinetti/compilers/issues)
