# Compilers
_My open course on Compilers, Grammars and Programming Languages_

This repository contains the code I wrote for my _self-inflicted_ class about Compilers. **Use it at your risks**.

## About the project

As side project for a MOOC on Compilers I built a new (basic) programming language. Turing-complete, but without supports for many things.

This repo contains the Grammar's specifications, as well as the compiler for this new language, written in C and organized in 4 modules:

- Lexical Analysis
- Parsing
- Semantic Analysis
- Code Generation
