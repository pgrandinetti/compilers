<p>Finite Automata&hellip; What a fancy name!</p>

<p>Formally, <strong>they are computational machines with a finite number of states</strong>.</p>

<p>For instance, a digital watch counting only hours and minutes is a finite state machine, because it can only in one out of 1440 states (24 &ldquo;hour state&rdquo; times 60 &ldquo;minute state&rdquo; for each hour).</p>

<p>A washing machine can be seen as a finite state machine too. It starts in the &ldquo;Ready&rdquo; state, then goes onto the &ldquo;Washing&rdquo; state, followed by the &ldquo;Drying&rdquo; state. There may be more intermediate states, but the total number is certainly finite!</p>

<p>The more important question to me, now, is what&rsquo;s the role of Finite Automata in the process of building a new programming Language? <strong>Where are Finite Automata used within Compilers?</strong></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In the previous article in this course we learned a great deal about Regular Expressions. I warmly recommend you to read that article again (see the references at the end). The key concept, however, are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The second step of the compilation is called Lexical Analysis.</li>
<li>Lexical Analysis takes care of transforming the original source code (that&rsquo;s a sequence of characters), into a sequence of substrings (called lexemes), each with its own class (such as keyword, operator, etc.).</li>
<li>Regular Expressions are used to match each lexeme with one class.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also showed examples regarding the last point. In summary, matching a lexeme to a class consists in the classic pattern-matching operation. For instance, you&rsquo;d want to match the lexeme</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma">&#34;if&#34;</pre></div>
<p>With the pattern <code>keyword</code>, given by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma">&#34;if | else | while | for | return&#34;</pre></div>
<p>In Python, you would do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">re</span>
<span class="n">pattern</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;r^(if|else|for|while|return)$&#39;</span>
<span class="n">st</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;if&#39;</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">st</span><span class="p">)))</span>  <span class="c1"># &gt;&gt; True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The point where Finite Automata enter the Compiler&rsquo;s game is <strong>the execution of Regular Expression</strong>. Or you can say, in the implementation of regular expressions. Let&rsquo;s see it more in detail.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-implement-a-regular-expression">How to implement a Regular Expression</h2>

<p>First of all, what does it mean to &ldquo;implement&rdquo; a regular expression? It means finding a procedure to decide whether a given sentence is valid for a given regular expression.</p>

<p>Remember that <strong>the overall objective is to accept or reject a sentence</strong>. A sentence is just a string (a sequence of characters). Given a regular language defined by a set of regular expressions, for each new sentence we must decide whether it is valid (accept) or not valid (reject) for this language.</p>

<p><strong>Finite Automata is the most commonly used tool to implement regular languages</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to give a detailed discussion about Finite Automata in this article (and it&rsquo;d probably be confusing too), so I simply want to discuss the core of it.</p>

<p>A Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is defined by the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>An input Alphabet (set of characters).</li>
<li>A finite set of states, $S$.</li>
<li>A start state, $n$ that belongs to $S$.</li>
<li>A set of terminal states, $F$ subset of $S$.</li>
<li>A set of transitions $T$, that are rules about going from one state to another one.</li>
</ul>

<p>A transition is a rule of the form &ldquo;when in state s1, if you read character c1 move to state s2. If you read c2 then move to state s3.&rdquo; Additionally, and very importantly, a DFA can have <strong>only one transition for each state for the same character</strong>. This is what it makes it deterministic.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very common to use graphs like the one below to represent DFA.</p>

<p><img src="/img/courses/compilers/DFA.png" alt="Example of Deterministic Finite Automata" /></p>

<p>The key element of this DFA are the following ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Alphabet is ${&ldquo;0&rdquo;, &ldquo;1&rdquo;}$ (you must know it in advance).</li>
<li>The start state is $n$, and it is indicated by the arrow entering it from nowhere.</li>
<li>The terminal states set is ${f}$. These are indicated by the double circled notations.</li>
<li>When in state $n$, if the char &ldquo;0&rdquo; is read then the machine goes into state $f$.</li>
<li>When in state $n$, if the character &ldquo;1&rdquo; is read then the machine stays in the same state.</li>
</ul>

<p>How does this DFA work? Let&rsquo;s assume we have the sentence &ldquo;110&rdquo; and must decide to accept or reject it. Let&rsquo;s see what happens step by step.</p>

<ul>
<li>The DFA starts in state $n$ and reads character &ldquo;1&rdquo; (the first in the sentence).</li>
<li>It stays in the same state, as prescribed by the transition.</li>
<li>It reads character &ldquo;1&rdquo; (the second in the sentence).</li>
<li>It stays in the same state.</li>
<li>It reads character &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It switches to state $f$.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point the input sentence has been read and the machine is in a terminal state. So the sentence is accepted.</p>

<p>To be more formal:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the input sentence is entirely read and the machine ends in a terminal state, then the sentence is accepted.</li>
<li>If the sentence is entirely read and the machine ends in a non terminal state, then the sentence is rejected.</li>
<li>If the sentence is not entirely read because the machine is stuck at any point, then the sentence is rejected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the sentence &ldquo;120&rdquo;.</p>

<ol>
<li>The DFA starts in state $n$ and reads character &ldquo;1&rdquo; (the first in the sentence).</li>
<li>It stays in the same state, as prescribed by the transition.</li>
<li>It reads character &ldquo;2&rdquo; (the second in the sentence).</li>
<li>There is no transition for this character from the current state, so the machine is stuck and the input is rejected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider &ldquo;101&rdquo;.</p>

<ol>
<li>The DFA starts in state $n$ and reads character &ldquo;1&rdquo; (the first in the sentence).</li>
<li>It stays in the same state.</li>
<li>It reads character &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It switches to state $f$.</li>
<li>It reads character &ldquo;1&rdquo;</li>
<li>There is no transition for this character from the current state, so the machine is stuck and the input is rejected.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, the question is: <strong>what does this DFA do in plain English?</strong></p>

<p>This DFA accept sentences of any length that are made by &ldquo;1&rdquo;s characters and have a &ldquo;0&rdquo; as last character only. So for example &ldquo;10&rdquo;, &ldquo;110&rdquo;, &ldquo;1110&rdquo; are all valid, but &ldquo;101&rdquo; and &ldquo;1010&rdquo; are not.</p>

<p>The key thing to know is that <strong>Deterministic Finite Automata and Regular Languages are equivalent formalisms</strong>. This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Given a DFA there will always be at least one Regular Language that accept the same set of sentences.</li>
<li>Given a Regular Language there always is at least one DFA that accept the same set of sentences.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, regular expressions have weaker expressivity than what you need to describe a full programming language. To handle that you need Context-Free Grammars.</p>

<p>Also, by construction of DFA is relatively easy to build a procedure that checks for acceptance / rejection of a sentence. It is basically as simple as one iterative loop over the characters of the sentence:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">curr_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">char</span> <span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">...</span> <span class="c1">// some sentence
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]){</span>
    <span class="n">curr_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lookup_transitions_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curr_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">is_terminal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curr_state</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="n">ACCEPT</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">REJECT</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This pseudo-code also lets you guess that the fastest way to implement a DFA in the memory of a real computer is not with a fancy-looking graph, but with a lookup table that maps transitions to states&hellip; but this is a story for another article.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what-about-grammars">Wait! What about Grammars?</h2>

<p>Right. I think I threw in a cryptic sentence a bit above: &ldquo;Regular expressions have weaker expressivity than what you need to describe a full programming language. To handle that you need Context-Free Grammars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What the heck does that mean?!</p>

<p>Like for Finite Automata, I am not going to go into a detailed analysis of Context-Free Grammars right now, so I will just leave you with a challenge.</p>

<p>Take a look at the following, simple, arithmetic expression.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma">(5 + (2 * (1+3)))</pre></div>
<p>This is an example of a well-formed expression, meaning that it&rsquo;s correctly written and, in particular, parentheses are correctly closed.</p>

<p>To express well-formed arithmetic expressions that use only sum and products with a Context-Free Grammar does not require much effort:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma">expression : sum
sum        : product (&#39;+&#39; product)*
product    : value (&#39;*&#39; value)*
value      : digit | (&#39;(&#39; expression &#39;)&#39;)
digit      : &#39;0&#39; | &#39;1&#39; | &#39;2&#39; | &#39;3&#39; | &#39;4&#39; | &#39;5&#39; | &#39;6&#39; | &#39;7&#39; | &#39;8&#39; | &#39;9&#39;</pre></div>
<p>So, my challenge for you is the following. Given just two of the basic arithmetic operations, sum <code>+</code> and product <code>*</code>, write a regular expression that catches all well-formed arithmetic expressions. Let me know when you are done with it.</p>
