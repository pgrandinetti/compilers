<p>Thanks to &ldquo;Compilers&rdquo; being the main keyword for this course, we also learned a great deal about Programming Language.</p>

<p>In a previous article I described what features can differentiate a programming language from the others. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>General Purpose vs Domain Specific Language.</li>
<li>High vs Low Level Language.</li>
<li>Interpreted vs Compiled Language.</li>
<li>Procedural vs Functional vs Object Oriented Language.</li>
<li>Typed vs Untyped Language.</li>
<li>Statically vs Dynamically Typed Language.</li>
<li>Static vs Dynamic Scope.</li>
<li>Automatically Managed Memory (Garbage Collector) vs Manual Memory Management.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are core features design of a language. The person (or the team) that works on that language development, and its compiler, has to make a choice for each of the above points, and even more.</p>

<p>As a result, there are a lot of Programming Languages out there. Each Language has its unique set of features, although, in all honesty, some languages are really similar.</p>

<p>A common question is <strong>what&rsquo;s the fastest programming language</strong>?</p>

<p>First of all, the question asked in this form makes little sense. For a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The quality of your code is more important than the efficiency of the language you use, for 99.9% of applications.</li>
<li>Actual speed of execution strongly depends on the hardware, and not just on the programming language.</li>
<li>Even on the same hardware, the current CPUs and RAM are such that in a tiny percentage of cases you will experience a performance difference due to the programming language.</li>
<li>There are many things that you can&rsquo;t know about how the Compiler modifies your code, to optimize the execution. I talked about them in a previous article.</li>
</ul>

<p>In different words, much before thinking about the performance of the language you chose, and of its compiler, you should focus on different things, much more important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the highest-quality code you can.</li>
<li>Use standard, well-known software pattern design. They improve readability and overall maintenance of the code, hence performance.</li>
<li>Choose well tested, robust, external libraries and packages if you need any.</li>
</ol>

<p>That said, the main question still stands, and it&rsquo;s an interesting one from a theoretical point of view.</p>

<p><strong>If we could implement the same algorithm, on the same hardware, with all other conditions being the same, in different Programming Languages, which would be the fastest?</strong></p>

<p>To answer that, and in view of all other important points I mentioned, I want to discuss <strong>the top-3 features that impact the efficiency</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="assembled-vs-compiled-vs-interpreted">Assembled vs Compiled vs Interpreted</h2>

<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s little doubt. <em>Assembled code is the fastest</em>.</p>

<p>Speaking from a theoretical point of view, if you could always write your programs in Assembly code, and you could also always write the best Assembly code that&rsquo;s possible, then yes, your Assembly code would always be the fastest.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because Assembly code doesn&rsquo;t need to pass through a Compiler. It&rsquo;s directly assembled into CPU instructions. Blazing fast.</p>

<p>Needless to say, that&rsquo;s quite a lot of hypotheses.</p>

<p>First of all, most modern programs would be painful to write in Assembly.</p>

<p>Secondly, very few programmers are trained to write efficient Assembly code. This is a direct consequence of the previous point. Therefore, it&rsquo;s highly possible that a good code, say in C, compiled with a good Compiler becomes more efficient than a poorly written Assembly code.</p>

<p>In other words, if you are not an Assembly developer, then a good Compiler can written better Assembly code than you, even if it&rsquo;s just a software!</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to write Assembly code, then again, one can make an educated statement: <strong>Compiled code is the second fastest</strong> (among the three types we are discussing).</p>

<p>Briefly explained, the reason is that Compilers produce so-called &ldquo;target code&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s basically machine code. On the other hand, Interpreters add one more layer between the execution environment for your program, and the Operating System, and that slows things down a bit.</p>

<h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>

<p>Why is C that fast?</p>

<p>As a programming language, C doesn&rsquo;t offer you anything special.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are no class and inheritance.</li>
<li>There is no dynamic typing.</li>
<li>Arrays boundaries are not checked (you don&rsquo;t know the length of an array a-priori).</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s nothing cleaning up memory after you (you must do it manually).</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, C code is just a little bit more abstract than Assembly code. This allows a very good C developer to write highly efficient code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, C code is not really safe. Every time you perform an operation on the computer memory, for example using memcpy, it&rsquo;s not even checked what was before in that memory locations, and if there&rsquo;s any overlap. Trust the programmer is C&rsquo;s spirit.</p>

<p>Other languages provide more abstraction and more security.</p>

<p>To start with, all OOP Languages allow us to define complex objects and new types, along with the operation that one can use on them.</p>

<p>Then, things like the Java Virtual Machine (or Python&rsquo;s interpreter) make the program execution overall much safer. But, they do spend some time to perform security checks, during the execution itself.</p>

<p>It must be said that Just-In-Time compilers exist for many languages, and they give great performance improvements. But that&rsquo;s an entirely different topic.</p>

<h2 id="tie-with-the-application">Tie with the Application</h2>

<p>If you work on an application and could write for it a C program that takes 1 week to write and runs in 0.1 seconds, or a Python program that takes 1 day to write, and runs in 5 seconds, which option would you choose?</p>

<p>I guess it really depends on the actual application.</p>

<p>If the program is meant to run once a day, then maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter how fast it is.</p>

<p>But if you must run it 100.000+ times a day, on several machines, then the CPU-time on these machines would be very different if you sue C or if you use Python. And so would be the total power consumption of your computers, which means money. In this case, spending one week writing good C code can save you lots of money.</p>

<p>The point I am making here is that execution speed is often a relative concept. Other factors play an important role, such as how much speed do you really need, what&rsquo;s the benefit of some speed improvement, as well as the trade-off between execution speed and development speed.</p>

<h2 id="but-so-which-programming-language-is-the-fastest">But so, Which Programming Language is the Fastest?!</h2>

<p>I purposefully avoided to give a firm answer on this question in the previous part of this article, because I think this is not the correct design question to ask when building something.</p>

<p>That said, if you really can&rsquo;t resist, just know that C is usually taken as reference point.</p>

<p>That means that performances of new languages are evaluated by comparing execution of standard algorithms with the runtime of the same algorithms implemented in C.</p>

<p>According to many sources (that you can google yourself) C, Rust, C++ and Fortran are always at the top of the many ratings for the fastest programming language.</p>

<p>As additional study, I warmly recommend to check you the link in the references to the page Bad Code Can Be Written In Any Language.</p>

<p>To conclude. <em>Which programming language is fastest? Should we care? How could we know?</em> (from <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/which-programs-are-fastest.html">The Benchmarks Game</a>).</p>
